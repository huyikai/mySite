# About me

Hey, I am Tigger Hu, a developer from China. my Chinese name is 胡义凯 (hú yì kaǐ).

I am currently working full-time and am an open sourceror in my spare time.This website is my personal homepage, where you can find my contact information, my full list of personal projects, and learning records, etc.

Outside of programming, I maintain a weekly running routine and participate in two half marathons each year. In 2023 alone, I ran a total of 366 kilometers, fully experiencing the power of endorphins. And I enjoy doing photography and traveling too, occasionally taking part-time jobs for wedding photography, I am fortunate to witness the happy moments of newlyweds. But what I enjoy the most is citywalk with my wife. We live in a very pleasant city, Qingdao, which is great for hanging out.

That concludes my introduction. If you're interested in further communication, feel free to reach out to me on WeChat at: huyikai, or you can email me at: <hyk_tiger@foxmail.com>.

Hope you can find something interesting here.
